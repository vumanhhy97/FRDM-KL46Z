The low_power_demo project supports the following boards and platforms:

FREEDOM Boards:
- FREEDOM-KL46Z

Tower cards:
- TWR-KL46Z48M

In order to switch to a different board:

1. Select the project for the overall platform (freedom or tower). 

2. Select the desired memory configuration from the drop menu in the project file. This determines the SRAM and/or flash configuration used.

NOTE: Do not remove the "IAR" or platform define ("FREEDOM" or "TOWER") from the defined symbols list.
